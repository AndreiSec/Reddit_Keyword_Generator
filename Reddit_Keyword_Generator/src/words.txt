keep up good work sir that's both mega 
inspirational motivational fucking legend hell yeah dude 
it's i'm currently admin 
i'm trying build python skills 
bolster skillset that's fair enough way 
post inspiring encouraging one more question 
trouble i'm wondering portfolio github 
boosting projects idea first project 
small local museum 
city wife connection 
desperately need new website need 
way catalog books papers 
accumulated over years both 
records benefit historical researchers 
build new website 
included web based cataloging application 
think good start 
freely confess one those 
people don't really understand blockchain maybe 
finally around learning 
that's interesting never thought 
definitely look thanks law 
miserable profession attracts 
worst personality types rewards questionable ethics poor 
behavior profession typically holds one 
top 5 spots lists alcoholism substance abuse 
clinical depression anxiety lots reasons 
won't derail thread 
much suffice it's awful profession 
statistics i've seen 10 years law 
school graduation somewhere between 50 60 graduating 
class won't practicing law more i'm 12 
years point 
someone works non profit doing 
feel good work disadvantaged populations it's still full 
backstabbing bullshit hate job actually 
despise thread inspired work 
few practice problems first time 
many months hopefully compound initiative 
eventually put 4 hours day op 
oh guess missed thanks 
way already started working yes 
difficulties 
onboarding person without background 
going start apply junior python 
jobs fall 
background well very interesting 
first days work looks thanks 
that's interesting definitely made want 
look django wow even more impressive removed 
quit job learn programming last september 
it's year now started 
python understood it's one 
powerful programming languages 6 months switched 
html css javascript now teaching myself 
react gatsby started applying jobs 
last month zero answers til now 
find hard actually practice 
learn tells haven't learned well 
enough want produce project 
attract recruiters love advice 
offer ah makes sense explains 
progressed much year thinking 
simply sleep entire year 
work during day code night still very 
impressive progress anyone reading simply quit 
job try wiggle python abilities 
current job task 
automated reduce wasted time work 
boost productivity automate show manager stick 
github i've 1 place 
specifically wear shirt tie otherwise 
always 2 piece suit question company 
culture self awareness both important 
absolutely such thing being overdressed 
agree u lanemik aim dress one notch 
above generally engineering positions especially software 
positions means business casual jeans usually 
fine best wearing suit tie 
viewed silly virtually company i've 
interviewed both engineering software worlds 
seen favorably exceptions 
course constitute minority it's 
management position though suit 
appropriate developer individual contributor 
general rule always ask point 
contact company usually someone hr 
kind dress expected appropriate 
interview can't go wrong way m 
uk 
go wrong shirt tie 
interview job now live perth 
australia far more casual 
taken long time used 
very unusual anyone 
level wear tie pretty much 
time see tie court 
building decade times 
worn tie twice interviews haven 
worn one probably never again 
work people levels business 
right up top level political offices 
tie required expected bottom line 
research dress code incidentally thought 
advice speaking recruitment consultants very good 
ask jobs 
applied purely 
go contact company candidates 
end up getting job 
put another candidate 
recruitment consultant short time 
worked manager recruitment company 
know tricks sales 
don care candidates although 
exceptions well done hard work 
hope enjoy new job tell 
example amazon specifically dressing 
business attire required 
wear business casual interview inasmuch 
evaluated wear seem 
both agree probably 
dress part fancy fancy 
casual casual you're trying 
give advice gives people best chance 
landing software engineering job seems 
goal post business 
attire bad advice except cases 
noted previously maybe several years go 
mid developer one 
those tuxedo shirts well dude stories 
inspire people need epic soundtracks 
special effects seeing one achieve 
one year time something amazing 
big up give shit dude 
tell something dedication straight up 
awe inspiring thank much 
find out money find 
multitude career platforms more confusing informative yes 
lot information 
feel getting bigger 
picture lots jobs time 
started relate watching those long 
python tutorials go watch another 
same content good hear those 
indeed help i've found pdf versions 
first three books recommended starting 
promptly i'm glad read haven't 
formal education i've seen way many 
self taught stories person engineering 
science related degree kind skews 
idea whether truly self taught programmer 
background field hope 
see update post future 
start job ok thank okay 
i'll look demand ontario make 
decision thanks damn ton 
relatively short window really appreciate post 
going try follow first couple read 
suggestions ve finance past 
4 years ve interested 
getting involved automation projects concluded python 
training through employer last week week 
covering blueprism wish luck thanks 
again shouldn't added post 
skeptical reading title usually 
that's case poster usually cs 
degree something similar crops up somewhere 
post reading comments 
similar position education location job wise 
feel year thing instead 
total hours made dubious 
days 6 12 hours learning 
case 6 hours learning 
equates week digress 
interesting post really useful resources actually pushed 
skip pygame chapter python crash course 
thanks taking time post congratulations 
starting wanted always onwards 
upwards yeah chapter 4 page 102 comma 
code exercise need create list 
need separate arguments list 
comma last one 
returned before think 
need implement separate function 
make work i'm reading next chapters 
return later commenter thanks dude 
inspiration oh cool same bere that's 
reassuring hear applied one place 
told uncertain terms 
government funding teenager thus weren't 
interested quite blow moralle guess
